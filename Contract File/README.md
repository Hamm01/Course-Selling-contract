# Contract for Accepting Payments and acknowledging back to the contract

For existing Course Selling or any Service selling Web2 website . which provide user service after user paid for the service.
Assignment is we want to accept payments in crypto and given access to service for user pays

Considering Given access to the course to be simple webhook that will hit with secret and user email
and that will provide the user access to service or course

    Contract written for

    - User has to sent some predefined ether to the contract, that predefined ether is set by admin
    - After user sends the ether the contract will emit the event.
    - The event should be montintored by backend which will provide the user access to the course . the backend will call webhook after receiving the event
    - When this task succeeds, the web2 backend should call the contract back to ack the payment, which means the user has been given access to the course

## Implementaion done Steps involved Below

    1. Written the Contract file with name courseContract.sol
    2. Have there contract written Context, Ownable and RegisterCourse
    3. Steps involved to deployment on any ethereum based net, it could be testnet or mainnet

       a.   for testing purposes we will deploy this on testnet
       b.   [link](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/) Sepolia ethererum testnet
       c.   first step is to compile the contract on Remix : https://remix.ethereum.org/
       d.   After compiling the contract we will get the ABI for the code and Bytecode,
       e.   copied the ABI into a seperate file that will be used in frontend project
       f.   now after compiling the code we need to deploy this to sepolia ethererum testnet
       g.   During deployment it needs the contract to put consturctor a _courseFee for the RegisterCourse contract
       h.   for this i am taking 10 dollars which is currently  0.00265 eth and we need to convert it into wei as gas
            is calculated in wei
       i.  so we need multiply the value of eth with 10^18 and this will give us 2650000000000000 wei
       j.   need to place this value for our predefined course fee when we are going to deploy.
       k.  we need metmask wallet connected to sepolia network and in deployment scrren of remix we will select inject provider
       l.  when we deploy this code will unmutable and will be deployed on testnet rightnow
       m.  here is the link to deployed contract
       https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xb5ed31d8a78b71d7ed85d02e253b0d9d79a9c678
       n.  we need to submit our contract to this address so that the written contract is visible to everyone
       o . Successfully submitted the contract at sepolia testnet and generated Bytecode and ABI for Contract Address [0xb5ed31d8a78b71d7ed85d02e253b0d9d79a9c678]
       p. now we can interact with functions on remix also to see the contract code is working fine or not
